Task: Develop a High-End Hybrid Archviz Workflow Landing Page

Core Objective: Create a single-page React application that visualizes an architectural visualization pipeline. Use AI ONBOARDING BASICS.md as the primary source for content and structure.

Tech Stack: React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide-react.

Layout & Navigation:

Vertical Scroll: Classic vertical layout optimized for desktop and mobile.

Sticky Progress Timeline: Implement a fixed-bottom navigation bar.

It must show all 7 stages.

Non-uniform spacing: Calculate segment widths based on the durations in Exterior_Workflow_Video_Script.md (e.g., Production/Fork should be wider than Planning).

Active state should highlight based on the current scroll position.

Key Component: The Strategic Fork (Stage 3):

Create an interactive section where the user chooses between Scenario A (Precision) and Scenario B (Artistic).

Interaction: Selection should toggle the display of sub-steps (3.1 3D Core and 3.2 Rendering) with specific content for each branch from the MD file.

Visuals: Switch accent colors between Cyber Blue (#00D1FF) for Precision and Safety Orange (#FF8A00) for Artistic.

Content Integration:

Parse stages 1-7 from AI ONBOARDING BASICS.md.

Include "Key Focus" points as highlighted badges for each section.

Add "Checkpoint" markers with distinct visual styling (as defined in the script).

Visual Style:

Dark Theme (Black/Deep Grey background).

High-quality image placeholders with aspect-ratio boxes.

Smooth entrance animations for each section using Framer Motion.

Minimalist, professional, "tech-noir" aesthetic.

Specific Instructions:

Reference the AI ONBOARDING BASICS.md file for all text content.

Use the images from the Slides.pdf as inspiration for the layout of the "Fork" and "Production" sections.
